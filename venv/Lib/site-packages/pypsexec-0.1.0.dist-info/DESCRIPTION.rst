Python PsExec Library
=====================

|License| |Travis Build| |AppVeyor Build| |Coverage|

This library can run commands on a remote Windows host through Python.
This means that it can be run on any host with Python and does not
require any binaries to be present or a specific OS. It uses SMB/RPC to
executable commands in a similar fashion to the popular PsExec tool.

The executable wrapper that is sent to the service is based on the
`PAExec <https://github.com/poweradminllc/PAExec>`__ library. PAExec is
an free, redistributable and open source equivalent to Microsoft’s
`PsExec <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec>`__
application. This program is stored as a binary in this package and is
used to run the remote service and start the process execution.

I would like to thank the developers of Power Admin for creating this
library as it has made this library a lot less complex than what it
would have been.

Features
--------

With pypsexec you can run commands of a remote Windows host like you
would with PsExec. Current you can use pypsexec to do the following;

-  Run as a specific local or domain user or the user
-  Run as the local SYSTEM account
-  Run as an interactive process
-  Specify the session the interactive process should run on
-  Specify the run level of the user token, ``highest`` or ``limited``
-  Set the priority of the process
-  Set a timeout for the remote process
-  Send input through the stdin pipe to the running process
-  Set the processors the process can run on

Further Info
------------

While this info is not necessary for you to use this library it can help
people understand what is happening under the hood. This library runs
the following steps when running a command;

-  Create an SMB connection to the host
-  Copies across the PAExec binary to the ``ADMIN$`` share of the remote
   host
-  Binds the Windows Service Manager to the opened ``IPC$`` tree using
   RPC
-  Creates and starts a Windows service as the ``SYSTEM`` account to run
   the binary copied
-  Connect to the PAExec named pipe the service creates
-  Sends the process details to the PAExec service through the pipe
-  Send a request to the PAExec service to start the process based on
   the settings sent
-  Connect to the newly spawned process’s stdout, stderr, stdin pipe (if
   not interactive or async)
-  Read the stdout/stderr pipe until the process is complete
-  Get the return code of the new process
-  Stop and remove the PAExec service
-  Remove the PAExec binary from the ``ADMIN$`` share
-  Disconnects from the SMB connection

In the case of a failed process, the PAExec service and binary may not
be removed from the host and may need to be done manually. This is only
the case for a critical error or the cleanup functions not being called.

By default the data being sent to and from the server is encrypted to
stop people listening in on the network from snooping your data.
Unfortunately this uses SMB encryption which was added in the SMB 3.x
dialects so hosts running Windows 7, Server 2008, or Server 2008 R2 will
not work with encryption.

This means that any data sent over the wire on these older versions of
Windows is viewable by anyone reading those packets. Any input or output
of the process comes through these packets so any secrets sent over the
network won’t be encrypted. PAExec tries to reduce this risk by doing a
simple XOR scramble of the settings set in ``run_executable`` so it
isn’t plaintext but it can be decoded by someone who knows the protocol.

Requirements
------------

-  Python 2.7, 2.7, 3.4-3.6
-  `smbprotocol <https://github.com/jborean93/smbprotocol>`__

To install pypsexec, simply run

``pip install pypsexec``

This will download the required packages that are required and get your
Python environment ready to do.

Out of the box, pypsexec supports authenticating to a Windows host with
NTLM authentication but users in a domain environment can take advantage
of Kerberos authentication as well for added security. Currently the
Windows implementation of the smbprotocol does not support Kerberos auth
but for other platforms you can add support by installing the kerberos
components of ``smbprotocol``;

::

    # for Debian/Ubuntu/etc:
    sudo apt-get install gcc python-dev libkrb5-dev
    pip install smbprotocol[kerberos]

    # for RHEL/CentOS/etc:
    sudo yum install gcc python-devel krb5-devel krb5-workstation python-devel
    pip install smbprotocol[kerberos]

From there to check that everything was installed correctly and the
correct GSSAPI extensions are available on that host, run

::

    try:
        from gssapi.raw import inquire_sec_context_by_oid
        print("python-gssapi extension is available")
    except ImportError as exc:
        print("python-gssapi extension is not available: %s" % str(exc))

If it isn’t available, then either a newer version of the system’s
gssapi implementation needs to be setup and python-gssapi compiled
against that newer version.

Remote Host Requirements
------------------------

The goal of this package to be able to run executables on a vanilla
remote Windows host with as little setup as possible. Unfortunately
there is still some setup required to get working depending on the OS
version and type that is being used. What pypsexec requires on the host
is;

-  SMB to be up and running on the Windows port and readable from the
   Python host
-  The ``ADMIN$`` share to be enabled with read/write access of the user
   configured
-  The above usually means the configured user is an administrator of
   the Windows host
-  At least SMB 2 on the host (Server 2008 and newer)

Firewall Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, Windows blocks the SMB port 445 and it needs to be opened up
before pypsexec can connect to the host. To do this run either one of
the following commands;

::

    # PowerShell (Windows 8 and Server 2012 or Newer)
    Set-NetFirewallRule -Name FPS-SMB-In-TCP -Enabled True

    # CMD (All OS's)
    netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="File and Printer Sharing (SMB-In)" dir=in new enable=Yes

This will open up inbound traffic to port ``445`` which is used by SMB.

User Account Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the desktop variants of Windows (7, 8, 10), UAC is enabled by default
and is set to filter a network logon of a local account of their
Administrative rights. Unfortunately pypsexec requires these rights to
both copy the executable to the ``ADMIN$`` share as well as create the
PAExec service on the host. With the default setting it will receive an
``ACCESS_IS_DENIED`` response when attempting either of the 2 as it’s
token does not have Administrative rights.

To get it working on these OS’, either configure UAC to not filter local
account tokens from a network logon or disable UAC entirely. Disabling
UAC is definitely an extreme step and should be avoided if possible but
disabling local token filtering means any network logons of an
Administrator account now gets the full rights of that user. To disable
local token filter run the following;

::

    $reg_path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"
    $reg_prop_name = "LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy"

    $reg_key = Get-Item -Path $reg_path
    $reg_prop = $reg_key.GetValue($reg_prop_name)
    if ($null -ne $reg_prop) {
        Remove-ItemProperty -Path $reg_path -Name $reg_prop_name
    }

    New-ItemProperty -Path $reg_path -Name $reg_prop_name -Value 1 -PropertyType DWord

To disable UAC entirely, run the following;

::

    $reg_path = "HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System"
    $reg_prop_name = "EnableLUA"

    $reg_key = Get-Item -Path $reg_path
    $reg_prop = $reg_key.GetValue($reg_prop_name)
    if ($null -ne $reg_prop) {
        Remove-ItemProperty -Path $reg_path -Name $reg_prop_name
    }

    New-ItemProperty -Path $reg_path -Name $reg_prop_name -Value 0 -PropertyType DWord

After running either of these scripts, the Windows host needs to be
rebooted before the policies are enacted.

Examples
--------

Here is an example of how to run a command with this library

::

    from pypsexec.client import Client

    # creates an encrypted connection to the host with the username and password
    c = Client("hostname", username="username", password="password")

    # set encrypt=False for Windows 7, Server 2008
    c = Client("hostname", username="username", password="password", encrypt=False)

    # if Kerberos is available, this will use the default credentials in the
    # credential cache
    c = Client("hostname")

    # you can also tell it to use a specific Kerberos principal in the cache
    # without a password
    c = Client("hostname", username="username@DOMAIN.LOCAL")

    c.connect()
    try:
        c.create_service()

        # After creating the service, you can run multiple exe's without
        # reconnecting

        # run a simple cmd.exe program with arguments
        stdout, stderr, rc = c.run_executable("cmd.exe",
                                              arguments="/c echo Hello World")

        # run whoami.exe as the SYSTEM account
        stdout, stderr, rc = c.run_executable("whoami.exe", use_system_account=True)

        # run command asynchronously (in background), the rc is the PID of the spawned service
        stdout, stderr, rc = c.run_executable("longrunning.exe",
                                              arguments="/s other args",
                                              asynchronous=True)

        # run whoami.exe as a specific user
        stdout, stderr, rc = c.run_executable("whoami",
                                              arguments="/all",
                                              username="local-user",
                                              password="password",
                                              run_elevated=True)
    finally:
        c.remove_service()
        c.disconnect()

In the case of a fatal failure, this project may leave behind some the
PAExec payload in ``C:\Windows`` or the service still installed. As
these are uniquely named they can build up over time. They can be
manually removed but you can also use pypsexec to cleanup them all up at
once. To do this run

::

    from pypsexec.client import Client

    c = Client("server", username="username", password="password")
    c.connect()
    c.cleanup()  # this is where the magic happens
    c.disconnect()

The script will delete any files that match ``C:\Windows\PAExec-*`` and
any services that match ``PAExec-*``. For an individual run, the
``remove_service()`` function should still be used.

Client Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating the main pypsexec ``Client`` object there are some
configuration options that can be set to control the process. These args
are;

-  ``server``: This needs to be set and is the host or IP address of the
   server to connect to
-  ``username``: The username to connect with. Can be ``None`` if
   ``python-gssapi`` is installed and a ticket has been granted in the
   local credential cache
-  ``password``: The password for ``username``. Can be ``None`` if
   ``python-gssapi`` is installed and a ticket has been granted for the
   user specified
-  ``port``: Override the default port of ``445`` when connecting to the
   server
-  ``encrypt``: Whether to encrypt the messages or not, default is
   ``True``. Server 2008, 2008 R2 and Windows 7 hosts do not support SMB
   Encryption and need this to be set to ``False``

Run Executable Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When calling ``run_executable``, there are multiple kwargs that can
define how the remote process will work. These args are;

-  ``executable``: (string) The path to the executable to be run
-  ``arguments``: (string) Arguments for the executable
-  ``processors``: (list) A list of processor numbers that the process
   can run on
-  ``asynchronous``: (bool) Doesn’t wait until the process is complete
   before returning. The ``rc`` returned by the function is the ``PID``
   of the async process, default is ``False``
-  ``load_profile``: (bool) Load the user’s profile, default is ``True``
-  ``interactive_session``: (int) The session ID to display the
   interactive process when ``interactive=True``, default is ``0``
-  ``interactive``: (bool) Runs the process as an interactive process.
   The stdout and stderr buffers will be ``None`` if ``True``, default
   ``False``
-  ``run_elevated``: (bool) When ``username`` is defined, will elevated
   permissions, default ``False``
-  ``run_limited``: (bool) When ``username`` is defined, will run the
   process under limited permissions, default ``False``
-  ``username``: (string) Used to run the process under a different user
   than the one that authenticated the SMB session
-  ``password``: (string) The password for ``username``
-  ``use_system_account``: (bool) Run the process as
   ``NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM``
-  ``working_dir``: (string) The working directory of the process,
   default ``C:\Windows\System32``
-  ``show_ui_on_win_logon``: (bool) Displays the UI on the Winlogon
   secure desktop when ``use_system_account=True``, default ``False``
-  ``priority``: (pypsexec.ProcessPriority) The priority level of the
   process, default ``NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS``
-  ``remote_log_path``: (string) A path on the remote host to log the
   PAExec service details
-  ``timeout_seconds``: (int) The maximum time the process can run for,
   default is ``0`` (no timeout)
-  ``stdout``: (pipe.OutputPipe) A class that implements pipe.OutputPipe
   that controls how the stdout output is processed and returned, will
   default to returning the byte string of the stdout. Is ignored when
   ``interactive=True`` and ``asynchronous=True``
-  ``stderr``: (pipe.OutputPipe) A class that implements pipe.OutputPipe
   that controls how the stderr output is processed and returned, will
   default to returning the byte string of the stderr. Is ignored when
   ``interactive=True`` and ``asynchronous=True``
-  ``stdin``: (bytes/generator) A byte string or generator that yields a
   byte string to send over the stdin pipe, does not work with
   ``interactive=True`` and ``asynchronous=True``

Logging
-------

This library uses the builtin Python logging library and can be used to
find out what is happening in the pypsexec process. Log messages are
logged to the ``pypsexec`` named logger as well as ``pypsexec.*`` where
``*`` is each python script in the ``pypsexec`` directory.

A way to enable the logging in your scripts through code is to add the
following to the top of the script being used;

::

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("pypsexec")
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)  # set to logging.INFO if you don't want DEBUG logs
    ch = logging.StreamHandler()
    ch.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - '
                                  '%(message)s')
    ch.setFormatter(formatter)
    logger.addHandler(ch)

These logs are generally useful when debugging issues as they give you a
more step by step snapshot of what it is doing and what may be going
wrong. The debug level will also print out a human readable string of
each SMB packet that is sent out from the client but this level can get
really verbose.

Testing
-------

To this module, you need to install some pre-requisites first. This can
be done by running;

::

    pip install -r requirements-test.txt

    # you can also run tox by installing tox
    pip install tox

From there to run the basic tests run;

::

    py.test -v --pep8 --cov pypsexec --cov-report term-missing

    # or with tox 2.7, 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6
    tox

There are extra tests that only run when certain environment variables
are set. To run these tests set the following variables;

-  ``PYPSEXEC_SERVER``: The hostname or IP to a Windows host
-  ``PYPSEXEC_USERNAME``: The username to use authenticate with
-  ``PYPSEXEC_PASSWORD``: The password for ``PYPSEXEC_USERNAME``

From there, you can just run ``tox`` or ``py.test`` with these
environment variables to run the integration tests.

Future
------

Some things I would be interested in looking at adding in the future
would be

-  Add a Python script that can be called to run adhoc commands like
   ``PsExec.exe``
